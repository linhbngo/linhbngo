> - Dijkstra, Edsger W. *"The structure of the "THE" multiprogramming system."* 
> In The origin of concurrent programming, pp. 139-152. Springer, New York, NY, 1968.
> - Dijkstra, Edsger W. *"Information streams sharing a finite buffer."* In Inf. Proc. 
> Letters, vol. 1, pp. 179-180. 1972.
> - Together with colleagues, developed semaphore as a single primitive for all things

> ## 3. Semaphore
> 
> - Is an object with an integer value that can be manipulated with two routines:
>   - [sem_wait()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_wait.3.html)
>   - [sem_post()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_post.3.html)
> - Needs to be initialized to some value. 
>   - [sem_init()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sem_init.3.html)
```


> ## 3. sem_wait() and sem_post()
> 
> - More important, how do we use `sem_wait()` and `sem_post()` to facilitate 
> synchronization for concurrency?

```


> ## 4. Aspects of sem_wait() and sem_post()
> 
> - `sem_wait()` and `sem_post()` are **atomic operations**. 
> - `sem_wait()` either return right away or it will cause the caller to wait.
> - `sem_post()` simply increase the value of the semaphore and wakes one of the waiting 
> thread up. 
> - The value of the semaphore, when negative, is equal to the number of waiting threads. 
```


> ## 5. Semaphore as lock (binary semaphore)

> ## 6. Semaphore as condition variable
>

```


> ## 7. Semaphore: producer/consumer I
> 
> - What is the risk if MAX > 1 and there are multiple producers/consumers?
>   - Race condition: two producers produce at the same time or two consumers
>   consume at the same time. 
> - What is currently missing from this implementation?
>   - Mutual exclusion
>

```


> ## 8. Semaphore: producer/consumer II
> 
> - Mutual exclusion is added, incorrectly. 
>   - Consumer runs first, then wait on `full` (but still holding `mutex`). 
>   - Producer sees negative mutex, decreases it further, then goes to sleep. 
>

```


> ## 9. Semaphore: producer/consumer III
> 
> - Mutual exclusion is added, correctly. 
>   - `full` and `empty` are for producers and consumers to wait on one another. 
>   - `mutex` for producers and consumers to wait among each group.

> ## 10. The dining philosophers
> 
> - Itâ€™s Dijkstra again. 
>   - There are five philosophers seating around a table. 
>   - Between each pair of philosophers there is a single fork (five forks total).
>   - Philosophers alternate between thinking and eating (need fork). 
>   - Two forks are needed to eat (one to the left and one to the right). 
>   - How to schedule fork grabbing pattern so that no one starves?
