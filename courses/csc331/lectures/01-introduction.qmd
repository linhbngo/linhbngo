# Introduction to Operating Systems

## 1. What happens when a computer program run?     
 
 The process
   - **fetches** an instruction from memory,
   - **decodes** the instruction, and
   - **executes** the instruction.
 This is the fundamental **Von Neumann** model of computing. 

```


## 2. Why do we need OS?
<img src="../fig/01-intro/01.png" alt="Codes to hardware to screen" style="height:400px">

 - What a programmer see is all code, lines of codes.
 - Underneath, there is a complex ecosystem of hardware components. 
 - How do we hide this complexity away from the programmers?

```

## 3. How do the OS help (1)?

 This is possible due to **virtualization**.
 - Virtualization: presents general, powerful, and easy-to-use **virtual** forms of 
 **physical** computing resources to users (*programmers*). 
 - The linkage between virtual interfaces and physical components are enabled through
 the OS' **system calls** (or **standard library**).  

```

## 4. How do the OS help (2)?

 - Each physical component in a computing system is considered a resource. 
 - The OS **manages** these resources so that multiple programs can access
 these resources (through the corresponding virtual interface) at the same time.  
 - This is called **concurrency**. 
```

## 5. Hands-on: Getting started

- Open a terminal (Windows Terminal or Mac Terminal). 
- Run the command to launch the image container for your platform:
- Windows:

~~~
$ podman run --rm --userns keep-id --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it -v /mnt/c/csc331:/home/$USER/csc331:Z localhost/csc-container /bin/bash
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Mac:

~~~
$ docker run --rm --userns=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it -v /Users/$USER/csc331:/home/$USER/csc331:Z csc-container /bin/bash
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Navigate to `/home/$USER/csc331`
- Clone the scripts [Dr. Arpaci-Dusseau's Git repo](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code).
- Change to directory `ostep-code/intro`, then run `make` to build the programs. 

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code.git
$ cd ostep-code/intro
$ make
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```

## 6. Hands-on: CPU Virtualization 

- Our workspace is limited within the scope of a single terminal (a single shell) 
to interact with the operating system. 
- `tmux`: *terminal multiplexer*. 
- `tmux` allows user to open multiple terminals and organize split-views (panes) 
within these terminals within a single original terminal. 
- We can run/keep track off multiple programs within a single terminal. 

~~~
$ cd ~/csc331/ostep-code/intro
$ tmux
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Splits the `tmux` terminal into vertical panes: first press the keys `Ctrl-b` then lift your fingers and press
the keys `Shift-5` (technical documents > often write this as `Ctrl-b` and `%`).

<img src="../fig/01-intro/03.png" alt="tmux terminal" style="height:500px">

- You can use `Ctrl-b` then the `left` and `right` arrows to move the active cursors between 
the two panes. 
- Move the cursor to the right channel and run the following commands to view the source code 
of `cpu.c`.
- Also run `nproc` in the right pane to figure out how many CPUs your container has access to. 

~~~
$ cat -n cpu.c
$ nproc
~~~
{: .language-bash} 

- Run the following command on the **left pane** to execute `cpu` program accordingly. 
  - *Reminder: use `Ctrl-b` then the `left` and `right` arrows to move the active cursors 
  between the two panes.* 
- In my case, I have 8 cores, so my commands will be extended for two more. 

~~~
$ (./cpu A &); (./cpu B &); (./cpu C &); (./cpu D &); (./cpu E &); (./cpu F &); (./cpu G &); (./cpu H &); (./cpu I)
~~~
{: .language-bash}

<img src="../fig/01-intro/04.png" alt="multiple runs of cpu" style="height:700px">

- To stop the running processes on the left pane, move to the right pane and running the
following commands:

~~~
$ ps aux | grep cpu
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Identify the process ID (the second columns), then use the `kill` to kill all the process IDs 
(see figure below). 

<img src="../fig/01-intro/05.png" alt="kill processes" style="height:700px">

```


## 7. The illusion of infinite CPU resources

- A limited number of physical CPUs can still be represented as infnite number of CPUs through 
**virtualization**.  
- The OS will **manage** the scheduling and allocation of the actual run on physical resources. 

{: .callout}


## 8. Hands-on: Memory Virtualization

- Type `exit` and hit `Enter` once to close one pane. 
- Type `exit` and hit `Enter` again to close tmux.  
- Run the following commands:

~~~
$ setarch `uname -m` -R /bin/bash
$ tmux
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Press `Ctrl-b` and then `Shift-%` to split the tmux screen into two 
vertical panes again. 
- In the right pane, run the following command:

~~~
$ cat -n mem.c
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- In the left pane, run the following command:

~~~
$ (./mem 100 &); (./mem 200)
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- When finished, kill the two memory processes using the `kill` command and the process ID 
shown in the parentheses. You should switch to the right pane for this task.

```

## 9. Do programs running concurrently occupy the same memory locations (addresses)?

 ## Answer     
  - No

{: .solution}
{: .challenge}


## 10. The illusion of dedicated memory resources

- Many running program share the physical memory space. 
- Each runnning program is presented with the illusion that they have access to their own private
memory. This is called **virtual address space**, which is mapped to physical memory space
by the OS.  
- Making memory references within one running program (within one's own virtual address space) 
does not affect the private virtual address space of others. 
- Without the `setarch` command, the location of variable `p` will be 
randomize within the virtual address space of a process. This is a security mechanism to 
prevent others from guessing and applying direct manipulation techniques to the physical 
memory location that acually contains `p`. 

{: .callout}


## 11. Concurrency

- As shown in **CPU Virtualization** and **Memory Virtualization** examples, the OS 
wants to manage many running programs at the same time.
- This is called **concurrency**, and it leads to a number of interesting challenges 
in designing and implementing various management mechanisms within the OS.

```

## 12. Hands-on: Concurrency

- Run `clear` command on both panes to clear the screen. 
- On the right pane, run the followings:

~~~
$ cat -n threads.c
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- On the left pane, run the following commands several times:

~~~
$ ./threads 50
$ ./threads 100
$ ./threads 200
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- `threads.c` creates two functions running at the same time, within the same memory 
space of the  main program.
- A single global variable named counter is being increased by both functions, thus 
the final value of counter should be twice that of the command line argument.
- Now run with bigger values.

~~~
$ ./threads 20000
$ ./threads 30000
$ ./threads 30000
$ ./threads 30000
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```

## 13. Observation

- Naive concurrency gives you wrong results.  
- Naive concurrency gives you wrong and inconsistent results. 

{: .callout}

## 14. Why does this happen?

 - At machine level, incrementing counter involves three steps:
   - Load value of counter from memory into register,
   - Increment this value in the register, and
   - Write the value of counter back to memory.
 - What should have happened:
   - One thread increments counter (all three steps), then the other thread increments
   counter, now with the updated value.
 - What really happened:
   - One thread increments counter.
   - While this thread has not done with all three steps, the other thread 
   steps in and attempts to increment the stale content of counter in memory.

```


## 15. Persistency

- When the programs stop, everything in memory goes away: counter, p, str.
- Physical components to store information persistently are needed.
- Input/output or I/O devices:
  - Hard drives
  - Solid-state drives
- Software managing these storage devices is called the file system.
- Examples of system calls/standard libraries supporting the file system:
  - `open()`
  - `write()`
  - `close()`

```

## 16. A brief history of operating system research and development

A good paper to read: [Hanser, Per Brinch. "The evolution of oeprating systems" 2001](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.1524&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

{: .callout}

## 17. Early operating systems: just libraries

- Include only library for commonly used functions.
- One program runs at a time.
- Manual loading of programs by human operator.

```

## 18. Beyond libraries: protection

- System calls
- Hardware privilege level
- User mode/kernel mode
- **trap**: the initiation of a system call to raise privilege from user mode to kernel mode. 

```


## 19. The era of multiprogramming

- Minicomputer
- **multiprogramming**: multiple programs being run with the OS switching among them. 
- Memory protection
- Concurrency

```

## 20. The modern era

- Personal computer
- DOS: the Disk Operating System
- Mac OS
- Multics (MIT) -> UNIX (Bell Labs) -> BSD (Berkeley) -> Sun OS/Linux

```
