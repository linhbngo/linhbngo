# Abstraction: The process
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a program and what is a process?"
objectives:
- "Understand the differences between a program and a process."
- "Know the possible states of a process."
keypoints:
- "A program is a static list of commands. When OS executes (runs) a program, the 
entire running operation is called a process."


> ## What is a program?
>
> - A program is a static list of intsructions and data.
> - When a program runs, the OS takes this list and asks the CPU to execute them. 
> - If we only have one CPU, how can we run more than one program at a time. 
```


> ## What is a process?
>
> - A process is a **running program**.
> - But the program itself is not running ...
>   - A process is an **abstraction** provided by the OS to describe the running of a program.   
> - What is a process made of?
>   - Memory that the process (running program) can address.
>   - Memory registers.
>   - Program counter. 
>   - Stack pointer.
>   - Frame pointer.
>   - I/O devices. 
```


> ## Process API
>
> The operating system provides an API to help managing processes. Minimally, the followings 
> are provided:
> - Create: an OS must have some methods to create new processes to run programs. 
> - Destroy: interface to destroy process forcefully.    
> - Wait: temporarily pausing the process. 
> - Miscellaneous Control: suspend and resume processes. 
> - Status: provide status about the state of the process. 
>   - Program counter. 
>   - Stack pointer.
>   - Frame pointer.
>   - I/O devices. 
```


> ## Process creation
>
> When a program is run, the OS performs the following steps: 
> - Load a program's code and static data into memory (the virtual address space
> of the process).
> - Allocate memory for run-time stack (for stack).     
> - Allocate memory for heap (used for dynamic memory allocation via `malloc` family).
> - Initialization: 
>   - File descriptor for standard input.
>   - File descriptor for standard output. 
>   - File descriptor for error. 
>   - *In Linux, everything is a file.*
> - Begin executing from **main()**.

> ## Process states
>
> A process can be in one of the three states. 
> - Running: the CPU is executing a process' instructions.
> - Ready: the process is ready to run, but the OS is not running 
> the process at the moment.
> - Blocked: the process has to perform some operation (e.g., I/O request
> to disk) that makes it not ready to run. 
```


> ## Process: state transition

```


> ## Process: state transition
>
> - When a process moves from **ready** to **running**, this means
> that it has been **scheduled** by the OS. 
> - When a process is moved from **running** to **ready**, this means
> that it has been descheduled by the OS. 
> - When an I/O request (within the process) is initiated, the **running** 
> process become **blocked** by the OS until the I/O request is completed. 
> Upon receiving the I/O completion signal, the OS moves the process' state
> from **blocked** to **ready**, to wait to be scheduled by the OS.

> ## Process: data structure
>
> - The OS is a program, and will data structures to track different pieces of information.
> that it has been **scheduled** by the OS. 
> - How does the OS track the status of processes?
>   - **process list** for all processes.  
>   - additional information for running process.  
>   - status of blocked process. 
> from **blocked** to **ready**, to wait to be scheduled by the OS.
