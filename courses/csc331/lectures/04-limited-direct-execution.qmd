# Limited Direct Execution"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How to efficiently virtualize the CPU with control?"
objectives:
- "First learning objective. (FIXME)"
keypoints:
- "virtualization of the CPU must be done in an efficient manner. At the same time, 
the OS must retain control over the system. This is accomplished by combining user/kernel
modes, trap table, timer interrupt, and context switching."


> ## 1. CPU virtualization recall
> - To support the illusion of having multple processes running concurrently on 
> a single physical CPU, we can have the CPU run one process for a while, then run
> another, and so on.
> - This is called **time sharing**. 
```

> ## 2. Design goals of CPU virtualization
> - Performance
>   - The process can be itself and run as fast as possible without frequent 
>   interaction with the OS.
> - Control
>   - We want to avoid the scenario where a process can run forever and take over 
>   all the machine's resources or a process performs unauthorized actions. This 
>   requires interaction with the OS. 
```

> ## 3. The question!

> How to **efficiently** virtualize the CPU with **control**?
```

> ## 4. Efficient
> 
> - The most efficient way to execute a process is through direct execution.

```

> ## 5. Problem: working with restricted operations
> - The process **should be able to perform restricted operations**, such as disk I/O, 
> open network connections, etc.
> - But we should not give the process complete control of the system.
> - Rephrase: The process **should be able to have its restricted operations performed**.
> - Solution: hardware support via processor modes
>   - User mode
>   - Kernel mode
```

> ## 6. Process modes
> - A **mode bit** is added to hardware to support distinguishing between user mode 
> and kernel mode. 
> - Some instructions are designated as privileged instructions that cannot be run 
> in user mode (only in kernel mode). 
> - A user-mode process trying to perform privileged instructions will raise a protection 
> fault and be killed. 
> - How can these instructions be called by a process in user-mode? 
>   - **System calls**
```

> ## 7. System calls
> - A small set of APIs for restricted operations.
>   - [XV6 system calls](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/syscall.h)
>   - Linux x86_64 has 335 systems called (0 to 334) - Last commit June 2, 2018.
>   - Linux uses a **sys_call_table** to keep the syscall handlers.
>   - [Syscall_64.tbl](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6f0d349d922ba44e4348a17a78ea51b7135965b1/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl)
> - These system calls enable user-mode process to have restricted operations performed 
> without having to gain complete control over the system.
```

> ## 8. How does a system call happen?
> 
> - To make a system call, the process need to switch from user mode to kernel mode, do 
> the privileged operation, and then switch back.
> - This is done through hardware support
>   - Require assembly instructions
>   - **trap**: go from user mode to kernel mode.
>   - **return-from-trap**: go back from kernel mode to user mode.

```

> ## 9. System calls versus normal C calls?
> 
> - Function declarations are the same
> - System calls
>   - Have **trap instruction** in them
>   - have extra level of indirection (movements between modes).
>   - perform restricted operations
>   - have bigger overhead and are slower than equivalent function calls.
>   - can use kernel stack.
```

> ## 10. Names of system calls
> 
> - User space definition:
>   - [libc's definition for write()](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=io/write.c;hb=HEAD)
> - Kernel definition:
>   - [Linux definition for write()](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/74673fc50babc9be22b32c4ce697fceb51c7671a/include/linux/syscalls.h)
> - The user space definition will eventually call the kernel definition.
```

> ## 11. Problem: switching processes
> 
> - A free running process may never stop or switch to another process.
> - OS needs to control the process, but how?
>   - Once a process is running, OS is NOT running (OS is but another process)
> - The question: How can OS regain control of the CPU from a process so that it can switch to another process?
```

> ## 12. First approach: cooperative processes
> 
> - All programmers promise to insert yield() into their code to give up CPU resources to 
> other people's program.
> - We have solved the problem and achieved eternal world peace.
> - Even in a perfect world, what happens if a process falls into an infinite loop prior 
> to calling yield()?
> - Collaborative multitasking (Windows 3.1X, Mac PowerPC)
```

> ## 13. Second approach: non-cooperative processes
> 
> - Similar to processor modes, the hardware once again provided assistance via 
> **timer interrupt.**
> - A timer device can be programmed to raise an interrupt periodically.
> - When the interrupt is raised, the running process stops, a pre-configured 
> interrupt handler in the OS runs.
> - The OS regains control.
```

> ## 14. Second approach: non-cooperative processes
> 
> - The OS first decides which process to switch to (with the help from the **scheduler**).
> - The OS executes a piece of assemble code (context switch).
>   - Save register values of the currently running process into its kernel stack.
>   - Restore register values of the soon running process from its kernel stack.
