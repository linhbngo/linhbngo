> ## 1. Process API
>
> Include three function calls:
> - fork()
> - exec()  
> - wait()  
```


> ## 2. fork()
>
> - ... is a system call. 
> - ... is used to create a new process.   
> - [Documentation for fork()](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html)    
> - Some important points:
>   - fork() creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. 
>   The new process is referred to as the child process.  The calling proces
>   is referred to as the parent process.
>   - The child process and the parent process run in separate memory
>   spaces.  **At the time of fork() both memory spaces have the same 
>   content**.  
>   - The child process is an exact duplicate of the parent process except
>   for the following points:
>     - The child has its own unique process ID, and this PID does not 
>     match the ID of any existing process group (setpgid(2)) or session.
>     - The child's parent process ID is the same as the parent's process
>     ID.
>     - The child does not inherit outstanding asynchronous I/O operations
>     from its parent (aio_read(3), aio_write(3)), nor does it inherit 
>     any asynchronous I/O contexts from its parent (see io_setup(2)).
>     - The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file 
>     descriptors.  Each file descriptor in the child refers to the same 
>     open file description (see open(2)) as the corresponding file 
>     descriptor in the parent.  This means that the two file 
>     descriptors share open file status flags, file offset, and 
>     signal-driven I/O attributes.
```


> ## 3. Hands-on: Getting started
>
> - Open a terminal (Windows Terminal or Mac Terminal). 
> - Run the command to launch the image container for your platform:
> - Windows:
> 
> ~~~
> $ podman run --rm --userns keep-id --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it -v /mnt/c/csc331:/home/$USER/csc331:Z localhost/csc-container /bin/bash
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> - Mac:
>
> ~~~
> $ docker run --rm --userns=host --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it -v /Users/$USER/csc331:/home/$USER/csc331:Z csc-container /bin/bash
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> - Navigate to `/home/$USER/csc331`
> - Change to directory `ostep-code/cpu-api`, then run `make` to build the programs. 
>
> ~~~
> $ cd ~/csc331/ostep-code/cpu-api
> $ make
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}

> ## 4. Hands-on: process creation using fork() 
> 
> ~~~
> $ cat -n p1.c
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> <img src="../fig/03-process-api/02.png" alt="File p1.c" style="height:500px">
>
> - Line 5-6: No idea why the author sets up the source code that way ...
> - Line 8: prints out hello world and the process identifier (pid) of the current process.
> - Line 9: calls `fork()`, which initiate the creation of a new process. The return of this fuction 
> call is assigned to variable `rc`. 
> - Line 10: If `rc` is negative, the function call failed and the program exits with return value 1. 
> This line is evaluated within the parent process (since the child process creation failed).
> - Line 14: If `rc` is non-negative
>   - The `fork` call is successful, and you now have **two** process. 
>     - The new process is an almost exact copy of the calling process.
>     - The new process does not start at `main()`, but begins immediately after `fork()`.
>   - The value of `rc` differs in each process. 
>     - The value of `rc` in the new process is `0`. 
>     - The value of `rc` in the parent process is non-zero and actually is the `pid` of the new process. 
> - Line 16 and line 19 confirms the above point by having the child process prints out its own 
> process ID and the parent process prints out the `rc` value. These two values should be the same. 
```


> ## 5. Hands-on: run p1 
> 
> - Run `p1` several times. 
> - *What do you notice? - also see my screenshot*

```


> ## 6. wait()/waitpid()/waitid()
>
> - ... belongs to a family of system calls. 
> - ... are used to make a process to *wait* for its child process. 
> - [Documentation for wait()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html)
> - Some important points:
>   - What are we waiting for? **state changes**. 
>     - The child process was stopped by a signal.  
>     - The child process terminated. 
>     - The child process was resumed by a signal. 
>   - **wait()**: suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its child processes terminates.
```


> ## 7. Hands-on: processes management using wait() 
> 
> ~~~
> $ cat -n p2.c

> - Line 1-4: Pay attention to the libraries included. 
> - Line 6-7: No idea why the author sets up the source code that way ...
> - Line 9: prints out hello world and the process identifier (pid) of the current process.

>   - Line 18: sleeps for one second. 
> - Line 19: This is the parent process (`rc` is non-negative and not equal to 0) 
>     - Line 21: calls the `wait()` function. 
>     - Line 22: prints out the information of the parent process.

> ## 9. exec()
>
> - [Documentation for exec()](https://linux.die.net/man/3/exec)
> - `fork()` lets you create and run a copy of the original process. 
> - `exec()` lets you run a different process in place of **the copy** of the original process. 
```


> ## 10. Hands-on: processes management using exec() 
>
> ~~~
> $ ./p3

>   - Line 23: `exec` replaces the current child process with a completely new process to 
>   execute the `wc` command.

```

> ## 11. Why fork(), wait(), and exec()?
>
> - The separation of `fork()` and `exec()` is essential to the building of a Linux shell.  
> - It lets the shell runs code after the call to `fork()`, but before the call to `exec()`.  
> - This facilitates a number of interesting features in the UNIX shell. 
```

> ## 12. The Shell
>
> - What is the UNIX shell?.  
> - In Unix, the shell is a program that interprets commands and acts as an intermediary between 
> the user and the inner workings of the operating system. Providing a command-line interface (that 
> is, the shell prompt or command prompt), the shell is analogous to DOS and serves a purpose similar 
> to graphical interfaces like Windows, Mac, and the X Window System. 
```

> ## 13. The Shell
>
> - What is the UNIX shell?.  
> - **In Unix, the shell is a program ...** 
```

> ## The Shell
>
> - **In Unix, the shell is a program ...** 
> - Therefore, the running shell is **a process**.
> - In other words, inside a running shell, if we want to run another program, we are essentially
> *asking a process (the running shell) to create and run another process*. 
```

> ## 14. When you run a program from the shell prompt ...
>
> The shell will  
> - find out where the program is in the file system. 
> - call `fork()` to create a new child process (to run the program). 
> - call one of the `exec()` family functions in the scope of this child process
> to actually load and run this program. 
> - call `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish (now with new process content) before
> giving user the **shell prompt** again.

```

> ## 16. Hands-on 7: redirection 
> 
> ~~~
> $ wc p3.c
> $ wc p3.c > newfile.txt
> $ cat newfile.txt
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> <img src="../fig/03-process-api/07.png" alt="Redirection" style="height:250px">
>
> The shell ... 
> - finds out where `wc` is in the file system. 
> - prepares `p3` as in input to `wc`. 
> - calls `fork()` to create a new child process to run the command.
> - recognizes that `>` represents a redirection, thus closes the file descriptor to 
> standard output and replaces it with a file descriptor to newfile.txt.
> - calls one of exec() family to run wc p3.c.
>   - output of wc p3.c are now send to newfile.txt.
> - calls wait() to wait for the child process to finish before giving user the prompt again. 
```

> ## 17. Hands-on 8: more on file descriptors 
> 
> ~~~
> $ ls
> $ ./p4
> $ ls
> $ cat p4.output
> $ cat -n p4.c
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> <img src="../fig/03-process-api/08.png" alt="View p4.c" style="height:700px">
>
> - `wc p4` should have printed out to terminal.
> - `close(STDOUT_FILENO)` closes the file descriptor that writes to the terminal 
> (hence free up that particular file descriptor ID).
> - `open(“./p4.output”, …)` creates a file descriptor for the p4.output file, but since the 
> file descriptor ID for the terminal is now free, this file descriptor is assigned to p4.output.
> - As `wc p4` is executed and attempts to write to terminal, it actually writes to p4.output instead.

> ## Hands-on 9: piping 
> 
> ~~~
> $ ls -l
> $ ls -l | grep p

```

> ## Other system calls ...
>
> - `kill()`: send signals to a process, including directive to pause, die, and other imperatives.
>   - http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html
>   - SIGINT: signal to terminate a process  
>   - SIGTSTP: pause the process (can be resumed later).
> - `signal()`: to catch a signal.
>   - http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html
