objectives:
- "Understand the design principles behind an efficient memory virtualization implementation."
- "Understand the required flexibility for applications."
- "Understand how to maintain control over memory location accessibility."
keypoints:
- "First key point. Brief Answer to questions. (FIXME)"


> ## 1. The questions?
> 
> - How can we build an efficient virtualization of memory?
> - How do we provide the flexibility needed by applications?
> - How do we maintain control over which memory locations an 
> application can access?
>
```


> ## 2. General technique
> 
> - Hardware-based address translation (address translation)
>   - HW transforms **virtual address** from memory access into **physical address**. 
> - The OS gets involved to ensure correct translations take place and manage memory 
> to keep track of and maintain control over free and used memory locations.
>
```


> ## 3. Initial assumptions
> 
> - User’s address space must be place **contiguously in physical memory**.
> - The size of the address space is **less than the size of physical memory**. 
> - Each address space is **exactly the same size**.
>
```

> ## 9. Dynamic relocation: Summary
> 
> - Pros:
>   - Highly efficient through simple translation mechanisms
>   - Provides protection
> - Cons:
>   - Wastage through **internal fragmentation** due to space inside
>   the allocated (contiguous) memory units are not fully utilized.

> - Reference is made to virtual address 100 (code segment)
>   - This is called the `offset`
>   - `physical address` = `physical segment base` + `offset` = 32K (32768) + 100 = 32868
> - Reference is made to virtual address 4200 (heap segment)
>   - What is the correct `offset`: 
>   - `offset` = `virtual address` - `virtual segment base` = 4200 - 4096 = 104
>   - `physical address` = `physical segment base` + `offset` = 34K (34816) + 104 = 34920
> - Reference is made to virtual address 7000?
>   - Look likes heap segment
>   - Is it heap segment?
>   - `offset` = `virtual address` - `virtual segment base` = 4200 - 4096 = 2904
>   - `physical address` = `physical segment base` + `offset` = 34K (34816) + 2904 = 37720
>   - This falls into physical addresses that are markedas **not in use**.
