## 2. A pragmatic look at cheating

- Most, if not all, problems that you are solving in this class are fairly
well-known and there exist solutions out there. 
- It is possible to search and copy and paste, but that defeats the purpose
of this class, which is for you to learn how to become better at programming
and technical interview. 
- Learng for the sake of learning, not for the grade.
