# Introduction to competitive programming

## 1. What is competitive programming?

- **Given well-known Computer Science (CS) problems, solve them as quickly as possible**
- `well-known CS problems`: We are dealing with **solved** problems and not new ones. 
- `solve`: produce working code. 
- `quickly`: time limitation. 



## 2. Types of (competitive) programmers:

- Uncompetitive programmer A: becomes confused, try something, anything. 
- Uncompetitive programmer B: realizes the simple general type of the problem, give up 
and select a different problem.
- Uncompetitive programmer C: realizes the complex type of the problem, attempts implementation
using a non-optimized approach, finishes after a very long time. 
- Competitive programmer D: does everything C did in less than 30 minutes. 
- Very competitive programmer E: does everything D did in less than 10 minutes, maybe using 
untraditional approaches. 
- **Class assumption**: everyone starts out at A and B. 
- **Class goal**: everyone reaches at least C by the end of the class. 
- Hopefully, if everyone keeps up practice and compete after the class ended, you 
will become D or E prior to going for technical interviews. 



## 3. How does competitive programming help with interviews?

- Most SDE (software development engineering) entry positions will involve
some forms of coding/algorithms questions. 
- While these questions are unlikely to be at the level of ICPC (not even divisional), 
the abilities to quickly recall data structures (DS) and algorithms (AL) will give you 
a significant advantage in these interviews. 
- Caveat: competitive programming will not train you in writing clean codes, designing 
software systems, following Scrum/Agile methodologies ...
- The catch: Those things are probably not asked in interviews anyway, and you will have 
time to develop those skills **after you passed the technical interview and get hired!**. 
- Also, the problem-solving skill of competitive programming is going to be usable everywhere. 



## 4. First set of tips to be competitive

1. Type faster!!!
  - Take the [typing test](https://www.typingtest.com).
  - Dr. Ngo's typing speed is 70wpm.
  - CSC 141 students in Fall 2019 averaged between 20-30 wpm. 
  - The book's authors' speeds are: 85-95, 55-65, and 70-80. 
  - What's yours?
2. Quickly identify problem-type.
  - This is important in ICPC competition: divide work among team members. 
  - Helps with recalling DS/AL. 
3. Understand how to do algorithm analysis (CSC 241)
 - Competition problems often come with time/space limits
 - You need to know what are the limits of your solutions. 
4. Master programming languages (also helps with interviews!)
 - C/C++, Java, Python
 - C/C++: faster, good bitwise-operations, 
 - Java/Python: extensive support libraries, easy to implement some simpler problems. 
5. Master the art of testing codes
 - Setup automated test scripts. 
 - Include all sample test cases. 
 - Run same test cases several times (to test for variable initialization/cleanup)
 - Test for corner cases: extreme max/min values, negative, very big values, empty values ...
 - Check for input format cases (rarely an issue in modern competitive programming contests)
6. Teamwork!
7. Practice, practice, and more practice!




## 5. Online judges
- We will utilize a number of online judging platform to evaluate the correctness of 
practice problems and also to have you participate in online training competitions. 
- You are to create accounts on the following platforms:
  - [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)
  - [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)



## 6. Getting started: anatomy of a programming contest problem
A programming contest problem usually contains the following components. 
- Background story/problem descriptions: intended to `deceive` and `confuse`. 
  - It is important to be able to `filter` out unimportant details. 
- Input and output description: details on how input is formatted and you should 
format your output. 
  - Pay attention to input constraints. 
-  Sample input and sample output: trivial test cases for contestants, to test 
basic understanding and verify the code's ability to parse input and display output
properly.
- Hints or Footnotes: additional details to help contestants. 



## 7. Getting started: getting the example codes
Clone the book's accompanying Git repository

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code.git
~~~
{:.bash-lang}




## 8. Getting started: typical input/output routines

There are a number of common input/output formats:
1. The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input
2. The multiple test cases are terminated by special values (0s or 1s)
3. The multiple test cases are terminated by the EOF signal. 
4. Variable number of inputs (type 1)
5. Variable number of inputs (type 2)



## 9. Your first problem: Moscow Dream
We will look at our very first problem from Kattis: [Moscow Dream](https://open.kattis.com/problems/moscowdream)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 Given 4 integers a, b, c, and n (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10, 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), output `YES` if
 a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, c ≥ 1, and a + b + c ≥ n, or output `NO` otherwise. 


 ## First solution
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/3529c879f8375d9e7eb29f355805bc0c.js?file=moscowdream.java"></script>
 - Can you get an Accepted (AC) verdict?


 ## Second solution
 - If a, b, and c are greater than 1, what is the minimum value that n could possibly be?
 - Correct and resubmit. 




## 10. UVa problem 10071: Back to High School Physics
[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=12&page=show_problem&problem=1012)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - `Initial velocity and acceleration`: bells and whistle
 - Actual information: Given velocity `v`, how far can the particle go after `2 * t`.  


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 3: The multiple test cases are terminated by the EOF signal.
 - Needs modification from the book's template code: it seems to be reading in from command line (using the `<` redirect rather than 
 a specific filename)


 ## Solution
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/3529c879f8375d9e7eb29f355805bc0c.js?file=10071.java"></script>
 - Correct and resubmit.

## 11. UVa problem 11614: Etruscan Warriors Never Play Chess
[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=78&page=show_problem&problem=2661)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - *In the first row, there is only one warrior; then, the second row contains two warriors; the third row contains three warriors, and so on. In general, each row i contains i warriors.*: `1+2+3+...`
 - Naive implementation: `for` loop until the sum is greater than the total number of warriors. 


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 1: The number of test cases is given on the first line.
 - Needs modification from the book's template code: it seems to be reading in from command line (using the `<` redirect rather than 
 a specific filename)


 ## Naive solution 1
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/3529c879f8375d9e7eb29f355805bc0c.js?file=11614_1.java"></script>

 > ## Why?
 > - What is the range of `n`?
 > - What is the range of `int`? 
 > - The word `integer` in the input description tricked us into not checking
 > the range.

 ## Revisiting the thinking process
 - `1+2+3+...`: Arithmetic sum
 
 <img src="../fig/ch01/01.png" style="height:50px">
 
 - `S`: the number of warriors (input)
 - `n`: number of terms in the arithmetic sum (expected output)
 - Simplification of the arithmetic sum equation brings up a different perspective:
 
 <img src="../fig/ch01/02.png" style="height:20px">

 - The problem becomes `estimate the solution of a quadratic equation`.

## 13. UVa problem 12250: Language Detection
[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=3402)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - *You will be given one of the six words mentioned above or any other word and you will have to try and detect the language it is from.*
 - Looks too simple to be true?


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 2: The multiple test cases are terminated by special values (0s or 1s)
 - Needs modification from the book's template code: it seems to be reading in from command line (using the `<` redirect rather than a specific filename)
 - Output needs to be formatted with `Case i:` with `i` is the line number of input. 
 - More details came out after viewing the input/output examples.

## 15. UVa problem 11764: Jumping Mario
[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=117&page=show_problem&problem=2864)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - You will be given the heights of N walls from left to right.
 - Mario is currently standing on the first wall.
 - He has to jump to the adjacent walls one after another until he reaches the last one.
 - That means, he will make (N − 1) jumps.
   - A high jump is one where Mario has to jump to a taller wall
   - a low jump is one where Mario has to jump to a shorter wall. 
 - Can you find out the total number of high jumps and low jumps Mario has to make?


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 2: The multiple test cases are terminated by special values (0s or 1s)
 - The first line of input is an integer T (T < 30) that indicates the number of test cases. 
   - Each case starts with an integer N (0 < N < 50) that determines the number of walls. 
   - The next line gives the height of the N walls from left to right. 
   - Each height is a positive integer not exceeding 10.
 - Output needs to be formatted with `Case i:` with `i` is the line number of input. 


 ## Thought process:
 - Read first line for case number, setup for loop. 
   - Why for loop? So that we can use the case number. 
 - Each iteration has two lines. 
   - one `nextInt` to grab the number of walls. 
   - another loop to start jumping from wall to wall.  
   - initializes high jump (`hj`) and low jump (`lj`) to 0 
   - increment the jumps accordingly  
 - Output needs to be formatted with `Case i:` with `i` is the line number of input.

## 17. UVa problem 10424: Love Calculator
[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=1365)

 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - You will be given two names (**String**).
 - The strings can contain any character. But only **a-z** and **A-Z** count.
 - Numeric range **1-26** for both **a-z** and **A-Z**.  
 - For each string, convert alphabet to numbers.
   - First add numbers together. 
   - Then add digits of results together **until it comes in one digit**. 
 - Result cannot be more than 100%
   - This means the smaller value is divided by the bigger value
   - a low jump is one where Mario has to jump to a shorter wall. 
 - Can you find out the total number of high jumps and low jumps Mario has to make?


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 3: The multiple test cases are terminated by EOF.
 - Each test case requires two lines of inputs.  
 - Output needs to be formatted with two decimal points and a `%` sign. 


 ## Thought process:
 - Read every two lines. We can have the following approaches:   
   - Read each character and compare characters with a preset array.
   - Read each character and check their ASCII value (what are the value 
   ranges for a-z and A-Z?) 
   - Remove all non-alphabet characters: adapted from [this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-remove-all-non-alphanumeric-characters-from-a-string-in-java/). 
 - With the last approach, could also compare with a `toUpperCase` or 
 `toLowerCase` call. 
 - Still need to remember the ASCII value of characters. 
   - What if I don't remember? 
   - Write a quick program to check. 
 - Write a function to get sum of all digits of a number.

[Problem's link](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=117&page=show_problem&problem=2864)


 ## Input/output format:
 - Type 4: Variables number of inputs.
 - Each line has three numbers: The power value of 2^N, and two initial seeds. 
 - Output: single value indicates the round. 


 ## Initial description (after taking away the bells and whistles)
 - Number of players are a power of two: guaranteed binary tree? 
 - Identify the round where two seeds will meet:
   - Assume always win
 - What is the patterns?
