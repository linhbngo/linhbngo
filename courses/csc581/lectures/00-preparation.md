# Preparing for this class

## 1. What are the challenges?

- Short time frame: 
  - 3 weeks
  - 5 days per week
  - 3 hours per day
- It is going to be very demanding! 



## 2. Know your environment:

- You need to become very comfortable with your Java development 
environment. 
  - Minimize down-time on technical issues. 
  - Increase actual coding time. 



## 3. Challenge:

Use an IDE of your choice, do the following in **five minutes** or less:
  -  Write a `hello.java` program in Java that prints out "Hello, World!". 
  -  Compile and run the program in a terminal using `javac` and `java`. 


## 4. Know your 241 (or able to search for concepts quickly)

- CSC 241 provides you with a valuable collection of data structures and
algorithms. 
- This course will provide you will an opportunity to implement or use 
these data structures and algorithms (if the language has a supporting 
library).
- Keep 241's book and notes close by!

## 5. Weekly assignment plan

- Individual weekly assignments:
  - Collection of invididual problems
  - Participation in the weekly LeetCode content on Saturday night. 
    - Does not have to be live. 
    - You get LeetCode coins if you participate live and get ranked!
- Individual weekly team assignments:
  - Friday 2.5 hours in-class live competition. 


## 6. A pragmatic look at cheating

- Most, if not all, problems that you are solving in this class are fairly
well-known and there exist solutions out there. 
- It is possible to search and copy and paste, but that defeats the purpose
of this class, which is for you to learn how to become better at programming
and technical interview. 
- Learng for the sake of learning, not for the grade.
