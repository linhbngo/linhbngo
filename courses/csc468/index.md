## University Policies 

### Academic & Personal Integrity
It is the responsibility of each student to adhere to the university’s standards 
for academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include any act that 
violates the rights of another student in academic work, that involves misrepresentation 
of your own work, or that disrupts the instruction of the course. Other violations include 
(but are not limited to): cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing, which 
means copying any part of another’s work and/or using ideas of another and presenting 
them as one’s own without giving proper credit to the source; selling, purchasing, or 
exchanging of term papers; falsifying of information; and using your own work from one 
class to fulfill the assignment for another class without significant modification. 
Proof of academic misconduct can result in the automatic failure and removal from this 
course. For questions regarding Academic Integrity, the No-Grade Policy, Sexual Harassment, 
or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer to the 
[Department Undergraduate Handbook](https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/computerScience/undergrad.aspx), 
the [Undergraduate Course Catalog](https://catalog.wcupa.edu/undergraduate/), 
the [Ram’s Eye View](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/STU/ramsEyeView/), or 
the [University Website](https://www.wcupa.edu).  

### Students with Disabilities 
If you have a disability that requires accommodations under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), please present your letter of accommodations and meet with me as 
soon as possible so that I can support your success in an informed manner. Accommodations 
cannot be granted retroactively. If you would like to know more about West Chester 
University’s Services for Students with Disabilities (OSSD), please visit them at 223 
Lawrence Center. Their phone number is 610-436-2564, their fax number is 610-436-2600, 
their email address is ossd@wcupa.edu, or visit the [OSSD website](https://www.wcupa.edu/universitycollege/ossd/). 
In an effort to assist students who either receive or may believe they are entitled 
to receive accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the University has appointed a student advocate to be 
a contact for students who have questions regarding the provision of their 
accommodations or their right to accommodations. The advocate will assist any student 
who may have questions regarding these rights. The Director for Equity and Compliance/Title 
IX Coordinator has been designated in this role. Students who need assistance with 
their rights to accommodations should contact them at 610-436-2433.

The [University’s Americans with Disabilities policy](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/adaPolicy.aspx) 
is available on the website.  If you encounter an area of this course that is not accessible to 
you, please contact me.  

### Excused Absences Policy 

Students are advised to carefully read and comply with the excused absences policy, including 
absences for university-sanctioned events, contained in the WCU Undergraduate Catalog. 
In particular, please note that the **responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests 
with the student**, that this policy does not excuse students from completing required academic 
work, and that professors can require a **fair alternative** to attendance on those days 
that students must be absent from class in order to participate in a University-Sanctioned Event.

### Reporting Incidents of Sexual Violence 
West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive 
educational environment for all students. In order to comply with the requirements of 
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the University’s commitment to offering 
supportive measures in accordance with the new regulations issued under Title IX, the 
University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by 
students to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The only exceptions to the faculty 
member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated 
by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or 
as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to 
report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a 
person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the person designated 
in the University Protection of Minors Policy. Information regarding the reporting of 
sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is 
set forth at the [webpage for the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/sexualMisconduct/default.aspx).  

### Inclusive Learning Environment and Anti-Racist Statement

Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to West Chester University’s mission as 
reflected in our [Mission Statement, Values Statement, Vision Statement](https://www.wcupa.edu/president/valuesAndVision.aspx) 
and [Strategic Plan: Pathways to Student Success](https://www.wcupa.edu/president/strategicPlan/default.aspx). 
We disavow racism and all actions that silence, threaten, or degrade historically 
marginalized groups in the U.S. We acknowledge that all members of this learning 
community may experience harm stemming from forms of oppression including but not 
limited to classism, ableism, heterosexism, sexism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, 
and xenophobia, and recognize that these forms of oppression are compounded by racism. 

Our core commitment as an institution of higher education shapes our expectation 
for behavior within this learning community, which represents diverse individual 
beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. Courteous and respectful behavior, 
interactions, and responses are expected from all members of the University. 
We must work together to make this a safe and productive learning environment 
for everyone. Part of this work is recognizing how race and other aspects of 
who we are shape our beliefs and our experiences as individuals. It is not 
enough to condemn acts of racism. For real, sustainable change, we must stand 
together as a diverse coalition against racism and oppression of any form, 
anywhere, at any time. 

Resources for education and action are available through WCU’s 
[Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/changeBeginsHere.aspx) 
(ODEI), DEI committees within departments or colleges, the student [ombudsperson](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/STU/studentOmbuds/), 
and centers on campus committed to doing this work (e.g., [Dowdy Multicultural Center](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/multicultural/), 
[Center for Women and Gender Equity](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/women-gender-equity/), and the 
[Center for Trans and Queer Advocacy](https://www.wcupa.edu/_services/transAndQueer/)). 

Guidance on how to report incidents of discrimination and harassment is available at the University’s 
[Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/diversityEquityInclusion/).

### Electronic Mail Policy 

It is expected that faculty, staff, and students activate and maintain regular 
access to University provided e-mail accounts. Official university communications, 
including those from your instructor, will be sent through your university e-mail 
account. You are responsible for accessing that mail to be sure to obtain official 
University communications. Failure to access will not exempt individuals from 
the responsibilities associated with this course.

## Resources for Student Success 

### Expectations for Student Success in Distance Education 

An online course uses technology to provide you, the student, with greater flexibility 
regarding when and where you learn.  To be a successful online learner you must 
capitalize on this increased flexibility by doing the following. 
- `Self-Motivation and Self-Discipline`: Active participation in online activities is expected. 
This means that you login to the course frequently, engage with the provided materials, and read 
and respond to communications in a timely and thoughtful manner.  Online courses require you to 
take more responsibility for your learning.    
- `Planning and Organization`: You will need disciplined work habits, effective time management 
skills, and the ability to work both alone and collaboratively if you wish to be successful 
in an online course.  You should expect to devote 9 to 12 hours per week to this course.  
You may find that you need to work harder than you would in a traditional lecture class.   
- `Communication Skills`: In an online course communication takes place primarily through 
the written word.  You need strong English reading and writing skills to express your 
thoughts.  Online courses also expect you to proactively reach out to your instructor 
for assistance when you need it.  Finally, pay attention to communication guidelines 
and be respectful of your fellow students when you communicate.        

### Minimum Student Technical Skills

You are expected to be competent in the use of computers, the World Wide Web, and commonly 
used software programs such as the Microsoft Office Suite of applications and Adobe PDF readers. 
In addition, you should be able to utilize a web-camera and microphone.  You should have a basic 
understanding of how to use the common elements of the university learning management system.

Students without experience using the university’s learning management system (Desire2Learn) 
can contact the Student Help Desk to arrange instruction, can contact Distance Education 
Support, or can complete tutorials in [Navigating Digital Learning](https://d2l.wcupa.edu/d2l/home/2513024).
