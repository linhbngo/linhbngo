  - Team description, including a 2-page resume for each team member. 
  - A Technical Report with the first two chapters: 
    - Chapter 1 describes **your team's vision**. This is 
    simply a design document (similar to the second figure in slide 1, Introduction to 
    Cloud Computing).
    - Chapter 2 provides a detailed description about what your team **propose** to do to 
    address the technical requirements above. 
  - 5-minute in-class presentation of project idea.
   
- Deliverable 2: (tentatively after Spring Break)
  - 10-minute in-class presentations without CI/CD service.
    - Should describe the current progress/accomplishment/challenges
  - Brief update on technical challenges/difficulties.  
  - Prediction on the feasibility of successful completion of the project. 
  - Updated the Technical Report with Chapter 3 and 4:
    - Chapter 3 provides a reasonably-detailed description about the 
    procedures to build the individual images of your components' Docker image. 
    Any testing/preliminary results should be included and discussed.
      - Data collection/creation and data tables management should be clearly discussed
    - Chapter 4 provides a brief description about your attempts to connect the 
    components together via Docker networks.

- Deliverable 3:
  - 10-minute in-class presentation of the project
  - Final chapter of Written Project Report with the project description in full, 
  self-evaluation regarding   whether the project has met all technical requirements 
  specified in Chapter 2. The Reference section must include link to the GitHub 
  repository of the team project.
