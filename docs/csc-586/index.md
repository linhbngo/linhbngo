**Grading Appeals**

Mistakes occasionally happen during the grading process. If you think a mistake has been made regarding your grades, you should send me an email with detailed justification within twenty days from the date the grades are available. No changes on grades will be made after one week from the date the grades are posted.



### Class Policy

**Office Hours**

Office hours are an opportunity to reinforce course topics either one-on-one or in small groups. If you are unable to attend during the posted time slots, I am happy to make an appointment.


**Attendance**

- Attendance is critical to the success of students in.
- We will take note of who attends, including occasionally using attendance check in place of a quiz score.
- If you miss a class, you are responsible for obtaining lecture notes, handouts, and homework assignments from fellow students.
- If the instructor is late for class, please wait 20 minutes before leaving.


**Excused Absences Policy for University-Sanctioned Event**

- Students are advised to carefully read and comply with the excused absences policy for university-sanctioned events contained in the WCU Undergraduate Catalog.
- In particular, please note that the “responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student,” that this policy does not excuse students from completing required academic work, and that professors can require a “fair alternative” to attendance on those days that students must be absent from class in order to participate in a University-Sanctioned Event.


**Late Work**

- Without prior approval from the instructors, late homework assignments will not be accepted but will be assigned a grade of zero.

- Unless accompanied with a valid medical or University excuse, all late submissions will be penalized.
A make-up for the exams will be given only with a valid medical or University excuse.

**Electronic Mail Policy**

- It is expected that faculty, staff, and students activate and maintain regular access to University provided e-mail accounts.

- Official university communications, including those from your instructor, will be sent through your university e-mail account.

- You are responsible for accessing that mail to be sure to obtain official University communications.
Failure to access will not exempt individuals from the responsibilities associated with this course.
Instructor Email Policy

- For individual issue, it is best to contact me via email. I check my email frequently during normal working hours (9-5) on weekdays, and I will try to respond quickly (hopefully the same day). I do also check email on weekends and evenings, but not nearly as frequently (almost never on Sundays). As a result, you should expect longer delays during these times.

- If you send me an assignment-related email right before a deadline, I may not answer it in time to be helpful.


### Academic Integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to adhere to the university’s standards for academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include any act that violates the rights of another student in academic work, that involves misrepresentation of your own work, or that disrupts the instruction of the course. Other violations include (but are not limited to): cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing, which means copying any part of another’s work and/or using ideas of another and presenting them as one’s own without giving proper credit to the source; selling, purchasing, or exchanging of term papers; falsifying of information; and using your own work from one class to fulfill the assignment for another class without significant modification. Proof of academic misconduct can result in the automatic failure and removal from this course.

For questions regarding Academic Integrity, Sexual Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer to the "Other" Menu of the Computer Science web page www.cs.wcupa.edu/, the Undergraduate Catalog, the Ram's Eye View, and the University website at www.wcupa.edu.
