### Class Policy

### Academic Integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to adhere to the university’s standards for academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include any act that violates the rights of another student in academic work, that involves misrepresentation of your own work, or that disrupts the instruction of the course. Other violations include (but are not limited to): cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing, which means copying any part of another’s work and/or using ideas of another and presenting them as one’s own without giving proper credit to the source; selling, purchasing, or exchanging of term papers; falsifying of information; and using your own work from one class to fulfill the assignment for another class without significant modification. Proof of academic misconduct can result in the automatic failure and removal from this course.

For questions regarding Academic Integrity, Sexual Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer to the “Other” Menu of the Computer Science web page www.cs.wcupa.edu/, the Undergraduate Catalog, the Ram’s Eye View, and the University website at www.wcupa.edu.
