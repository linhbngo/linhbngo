## <center> NIST: Essential Characteristics </center>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### On-demand self-service (C1)
- Computing capabilities can be automatically and **unilaterally** provisioned by users **without human interaction** with the cloud provider.
- What are computing capabilities
  - server time, network storage, number of servers ...
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Broad network access (C2)
- Computing capabilities:
  - are made available over the (high speed) network
  - can be accessed through standard mechanisms
- This enables inclusion of heterogeneous computing platforms
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Resource pooling (C3)
- Computing resources of cloud provider are pooled together to server multiple users.
- Computing resources can be storage, processing power, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines.
- Location independence
  - Users have not control over exact location of resources
- Carry significant implications over
  - performance
  - scalability
  - security
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Rapid elasticity (C4)
- Capabilities (or resources) can be rapidly and elastically provisioned.
- From users' perspective, resources are potentially unlimited.
- Cloud providers should approach users with an understanding that predicting a ceiling of usage is difficult.
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Measured service (C5)
- Capability of service/resource abstractions are metered:
  - storage
  - processing
  - bandwidth
  - active user accounts
  - ...

### Multi-tenant Technology

[Bezemer, C.P., Zaidman, A., Platzbeecker, B., Hurkmans, T. and Hart, A.T., 2010, September. Enabling multi-tenancy: An industrial experience report. In Software Maintenance (ICSM), 2010 IEEE International Conference on (pp. 1-8). IEEE.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.176.8005&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

- "Multiple customers - tenants share the same application and database instance. All the while, the tenants enjoy a highly configurable application, making it appear that the application is deployed on a dedicated server."

<section data-markdown>
### Getting on taz

- Log into taz.cs.wcup.edu (If you have Windows, [MobaXterm Home Installer Edition](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html) is recommended. )

```
$ ssh taz.cs.wcupa.edu
```

- If you have not already done so, set up and view your SSH public key (use default answers for all questions).

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

- Use this key in your CloudLab project application request form. 
- If you already have a CloudLab account, add this key to your CloudLab account.

## <center> NIST: Three Service Models </center>

- SaaS: Software-as-a-Service
- PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service
- IaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### SaaS: Software-as-a-Service

- Vendor controlled applications that are accessed over the network by users.
- Characteristics:
  - Network-based access
  - Multi-tenancy
  - Single software release for all
- Examples:
  - Applications in the Google Suite
  - Dropbox
  - Cisco WebEx
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### SaaS Application Design

- Net native
  - Cloud-specific design, development, and deployment
  - Multi-tenant data
  - Built-in metering and management
  - Browser-based
  - Customization via configuration
- High degree of configurability, efficiency, and scalability
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### SaaS Disadvantages

- SaaS providers are dependent on network and cloud service providers. 
  - [A Dropbox story](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/)
- Performance is dependent on individual client's bandwidth.
- Security
  - Good: Better security than personal computers
  - Bad: SaaS vendors (and cloud providers) are in charge of the data
  - Ugly: Privacy
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### SaaS and Privacy

- Who owns your data in SaaS?

### SaaS and Privacy

- Who has access to your data in SaaS?
- [Google ToS](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en&gl=us)
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service

- Vendors provide development environment.
  - Tools and technologies are selected by vendors.
  - Users maintain control over data (application) life-cycle.
- Examples:
  - Google App Engine
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Heroku
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### PaaS Architectural Characteristics

- Support multi-tenancy at various scale: sessions, processes, and data.
  - Isolation at: physical, virtual, and logical levels
  - [Oracle multi-tenancy strategy for PaaS](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/paas-multi-tenancy-092593.html)
- Native scalability
  - Load balancing and fail-over (AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
- Native integrated management
  - Performance
  - Resource consumption/utilization
  - Load
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### PaaS Disadvantages

- Inherits all from SaaS 
- Options on technologies and tools are limited by the PaaS vendors
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### IaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service

- Vendors provide computing resources.
- Users provision computing resources.
  - Compute resources include processing, storage, memory, network etc.
  - Users are provided with customized virtual machines.
- Users maintain control over: 
  - Operating system, memory
  - Storage, 
  - Servers and deployment configurations
  - Some limited control over network resources via software-defined networking
- Examples:
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
  - Google Cloud Platform
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### IaaS Advantages

- Infrastructure scalability
- Native-integrated management via vendors' utilities
  - Performance, resource consumption/utilization, load
- Economical cost
  - Hardware, IT support
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### IaaS Disadvantages

- Require more technical efforts than SaaS and PaaS.
