### Software requirements
As laptop style and model can vary, the following common (and free) software environment will be enforced for all lectures and programming assignments:

- Virtual Environment: Oracle VirtualBox
- Other software packages will be specified and installed inside the virtual OS as needed.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Git

- The class materials, including source codes, will be disseminated via Git. Being able to use Git is a critical skill for most, if not all software developers and/or IT professionals. There are many tutorials already available online for Git. Some of the more helpful ones include Github's, "the simple guide", and Atlassian's);

- It would be a mistake if you just attempt to access the class materials via the web browser. "This is a mistake. Just learn Git. The command line interface is faster and more powerful, and you're going to need to learn it at some point in your life. Why not today?" - Dr. Jacob Sorber, Clemson University.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Course Materials
- Lecture slides and example codes will be available online via links inside the course' D2L page
- Links to papers on subjects we will be discussing in class will also be listed and/or embedded in the slides.
- West Chester University maintains extensive licensed products to academic publishers such as ACM, IEEE, Elsevier, and Springer, and many of the papers required for this course will be available through the library's online database.
- Google Scholar is another excellent source for downloading preprint or open-source versions of papers.

<section data-markdown>
### Grading Appeals

Mistakes occasionally happen during the grading process. If you think a mistake has been made regarding your grades, you should send me an email with detailed justification within one week of the date the grades are available. No changes on grades will be made after one week from the date the grades are posted.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Participation

- Participation accounts for 5% of your grade.
- This part of your grade will be determined by:
    - whether or not you show up to class and office hours, and
    - how actively you participate (ask questions, make comments, contribute to activities) during class.
- Participation grades will be assigned in a coarsely manner:
    - 100% to students who are fully engaged active participants,
    - 50% to students who are nominally engaged (physically there and willing to participate when asked to), and
    - 0% for students who really aren't engaged (trying to hide).
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Office Hours

- Office hours are an opportunity to reinforce course topics either one-on-one or in small groups. If you are unable to attend during the posted time slots, I am happy to make an appointment.

### Attendance Policy

- Attendance is critical to the success of students in this class.
- We will take note of who attends, including occasionally using attendance check in place of a quiz score.
- If you miss a class, you are responsible for obtaining lecture notes, handouts, and homework assignments from fellow students.
- If the instructor is late for class, please wait 20 minutes before leaving.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Excused Absences Policy for University-Sanctioned Event

- Students are advised to carefully read and comply with the excused absences policy for university-sanctioned events contained in the WCU Undergraduate Catalog.
- In particular, please note that the “responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student,” that this policy does not excuse students from completing required academic work, and that professors can require a “fair alternative” to attendance on those days that students must be absent from class in order to participate in a University-Sanctioned Event.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Late Work
- Without prior approval from the instructors, late homework assignments will not be accepted but will be assigned a grade of zero.
- Unless accompanied with a valid medical or University excuse, all late submissions will be penalized.
- A make-up for the exams will be given only with a valid medical or University excuse.
</section>


<section data-markdown>
### Academic Integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to adhere to the university's standards for academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include any act that violates the rights of another student in academic work, that involves misrepresentation of your own work, or that disrupts the instruction of the course.

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Academic Integrity
Other violations include (but are not limited to):

- cheating on assignments or examinations;
- plagiarizing, which means copying any part of another's work and/or using ideas of another and presenting them as one's own without giving proper credit to the source;
- selling, purchasing, or exchanging of term papers;
- falsifying of information; and
- using your own work from one class to fulfill the assignment for another class without significant modification.

Proof of academic misconduct can result in the automatic failure and removal from this course.
</section>

### Title IX Statement

- West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator, Ms. Lynn Klingensmith.
- The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the person designated in the University protection of minors policy. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at the webpage for the Office of Social Equity at http://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/social.equity/.

### Cluster Computing

- Prior to 1996, to achieve better computing performance (better speed, more memory, more storage ...), people relied on special-purpose computers (Cray, AIX).
- In 1996, the Beowulf model was developed, enabling construction of **computing clusters**:
  - Provide better overall performance than average computers,
  - Are designed by connecting individual standard computers (commodity off-the-shelves).
- Highly scalable (potentially infinite)

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### The Building is the Limit

- **Scaling out**: Adding additional computers of similar performance to an existing cluster of computers.
- Simple, inexpensive approach
- Limited by how much space available
- Limited by AC and power capacity

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### The Funding is the Limit

- **Scaling up**: Replacing existing computers in a cluster with better, fast computers
- More expensive
- More technical challenge to ensure stable performance

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Difference in perspectives

- Academic: How can I get more performance with little funding that I have?
- Industry: How can I avoid investing money into fixed cost when I only need bursts of performance?

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Next generations of cluster computing

- Grid Computing
- Cloud Computing

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Grid Computing

- Bring together computing resources (clusters of computers) from geographically distributed locations.
- Individual resources are under separate administrative domains.
- Computing resources are highly heterogeneous (and the users have to take this into account).
- A computing job with individual disjoint and asynchronous tasks can send these tasks over different resources in a grid computing federation. 
- Suitable for academic research, not suitable for industry. 

</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Cloud Computing

- Bring together computing resources from geographically distributed locations.
- Difference in administrative domains should be transparent to users. 
- The heterogeneity of computing resources should be transparent to users.
- Any type of computing job should be executable in a cloud computing environment.

### Cloud Computing: Early Definition

*A computing cloud is a set of network enabled services, providing scalable, QoS guaranteed, normally personalized, inexpensive computing infrastructures on demand, which could be accessed in a simple and pervasive way*

Wang L, Von Laszewski G, Younge A, He X, Kunze M, Tao J, Fu C. Cloud computing: a perspective study. New Generation Computing. 2010 Apr 1;28(2):137-46.

Cloud computing is too complex to be defined by just a sentence.

### Cloud Computing: Formal Definition by NIST

- Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
