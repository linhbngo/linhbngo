### Course Descriptions

This course will introduce three fundamental concepts in operating system (OS):
Virtualization, Concurrency, and Persistence.

- *Virtualization*: How OS creates abstractions through which programmers can
interact with the underlying hardware
(e.g., *processes*, *memory spaces*, and *CPU scheduling*).

- *Concurrency*: How OS supports sharing of physical resources
among these abstractions (e.g., *thread*, *lock*, and *semaphores*).

- *Persistence*: How OS enables the long term management of information,
produced or required by computer programs, in a manner that persists beyond the scope or the duration
of these programs (e.g., *I/O devices* and *file systems*).

Understanding how operating systems work will facilitate better understanding about how programs are
run by the computer hardware. This will lead to more efficient, stable, and secure programs.

### Git

- The class materials, including source codes, will be disseminated via Git. Being able to use Git is a critical skill for most, if not all software developers and/or IT professionals. There are many tutorials already available online for Git. Some of the more helpful ones include Github's, "the simple guide", and Atlassian's);

- It would be a mistake if you just attempt to access the class materials via the web browser. "This is a mistake. Just learn Git. The command line interface is faster and more powerful, and you're going to need to learn it at some point in your life. Why not today?" - Dr. Jacob Sorber, Clemson University.

### Grading Appeals

Mistakes occasionally happen during the grading process. If you think a mistake has been made regarding your grades, you should send me an email with detailed justification within one week of the date the grades are available. No changes on grades will be made after one week from the date the grades are posted.
</section>

<section data-markdown>
### Participation

- Participation accounts for 5% of your grade.
- This part of your grade will be determined by:
    - whether or not you show up to class and office hours, and
    - how actively you participate (ask questions, make comments, contribute to activities) during class.
- Participation grades will be assigned in a coarsely manner:
    - 100% to students who are fully engaged active participants,
    - 50% to students who are nominally engaged (physically there and willing to participate when asked to), and
    - 0% for students who really aren't engaged (trying to hide).
</section>

### Title IX Statement

- West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator, Ms. Lynn Klingensmith.
- The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the person designated in the University protection of minors policy. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at the webpage for the Office of Social Equity at http://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/social.equity/.
