### Course Description

An introduction to programming using Java. Topics covered include basic program
layout, primitive data types and strings, control structures (loops and decisions),
methods, parameters, and text file input/output.

**Learning Objectives**

- Think critically and analytically; develop algorithmic solutions; implement and test these solutions.
- Employ quantitative analysis and mathematical methods to analyze problem
situations and use mathematical models to develop solutions
- Design programs using a top-down, structured program approach
- Write computer programs: including outline program solutions using pseudo-code,
write actual code using the Java programming language, and document the code appropriately


### Course Requirements

**Prerequisites**

- There is no prerequisite for this course

**Required Textbook**

- **Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures**, Gaddis and Muganda, 3rd Edition, Pearson. ISBN-13: 780134787961

**References**

- **Introduction to Programming Using Java**, David Eck, 2019 Edition. Available online by the author
at http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/


**Required Hardware**

Personal flash drive (USB stick) – or any convenient way of saving files. Files
saved locally on WCU machines are deleted overnight. It will be inconvenient to
use email as your method for saving files. Some students utilize a cloud solution
(e.g. Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, etc). Saving via a flash drive
is the recommended approach.

**Required Software**

The computing environment that the Computer Science Department has chosen for
this course is the Java language, together with the jGrasp IDE (integrated
development environment). (Available at no cost, links will be provided.)


### Course Materials

- Lecture slides and example codes will be available online via links inside the
course’ D2L page and the faculty's page at https://www.cs.wcupa.edu/lngo/docs/csc-141/

- Links to papers on subjects we will be discussing in class will also be listed
and/or embedded in the slides.

- West Chester University maintains extensive licensed products to academic
publishers such as ACM, IEEE, Elsevier, and Springer, and many of the papers
required for this course will be available through the library's online database.

- Google Scholar is another excellent source for downloading preprint or
open-source versions of papers.

### Grading

Grades will be based on the following distribution:

- Assignments: 60%
  - At least 6 programming assignments, each of which has multiple problems.
- Quizzes: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 10%
- Final Exam: 5%
- Attendance and Participation: 5%

Letter grades are assigned according to the following scale:

| Number | 100-93 | 92-90 | 89-87 | 86-83 | 82-80 | 79-77 | 76-73 | 72-70 | 69-67 | 66-63 | 62-60 | <= 59 |
| Letter | A	| A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | F |


**Grading Appeals**

Mistakes occasionally happen during the grading process. If you think a mistake has been made regarding your grades, you should send me an email with detailed justification within one week of the date the grades are available. No changes on grades will be made after twenty days from the date the grades are posted.



### Class Policy

**Office Hours**

Office hours are an opportunity to reinforce course topics either one-on-one or in small groups. If you are unable to attend during the posted time slots, I am happy to make an appointment.


**Attendance**

- Attendance is critical to the success of students in.
- We will take note of who attends, including occasionally using attendance check in place of a quiz score.
- If you miss a class, you are responsible for obtaining lecture notes, handouts, and homework assignments from fellow students.
- If the instructor is late for class, please wait 20 minutes before leaving.


**Excused Absences Policy for University-Sanctioned Event**

- Students are advised to carefully read and comply with the excused absences policy for university-sanctioned events contained in the WCU Undergraduate Catalog.
- In particular, please note that the “responsibility for meeting academic requirements rests with the student,” that this policy does not excuse students from completing required academic work, and that professors can require a “fair alternative” to attendance on those days that students must be absent from class in order to participate in a University-Sanctioned Event.


**Late Work**

- Without prior approval from the instructors, late homework assignments will not be accepted but will be assigned a grade of zero.

- Unless accompanied with a valid medical or University excuse, all late submissions will be penalized.
A make-up for the exams will be given only with a valid medical or University excuse.

**Electronic Mail Policy**

- It is expected that faculty, staff, and students activate and maintain regular access to University provided e-mail accounts.

- Official university communications, including those from your instructor, will be sent through your university e-mail account.

- You are responsible for accessing that mail to be sure to obtain official University communications.
Failure to access will not exempt individuals from the responsibilities associated with this course.
Instructor Email Policy

- For individual issue, it is best to contact me via email. I check my email frequently during normal working hours (9-5) on weekdays, and I will try to respond quickly (hopefully the same day). I do also check email on weekends and evenings, but not nearly as frequently (almost never on Sundays). As a result, you should expect longer delays during these times.

- If you send me an assignment-related email right before a deadline, I may not answer it in time to be helpful.


### Academic Integrity

It is the responsibility of each student to adhere to the university’s standards for academic integrity. Violations of academic integrity include any act that violates the rights of another student in academic work, that involves misrepresentation of your own work, or that disrupts the instruction of the course. Other violations include (but are not limited to): cheating on assignments or examinations; plagiarizing, which means copying any part of another’s work and/or using ideas of another and presenting them as one’s own without giving proper credit to the source; selling, purchasing, or exchanging of term papers; falsifying of information; and using your own work from one class to fulfill the assignment for another class without significant modification. Proof of academic misconduct can result in the automatic failure and removal from this course.

For questions regarding Academic Integrity, Sexual Harassment, or the Student Code of Conduct, students are encouraged to refer to the “Other” Menu of the Computer Science web page www.cs.wcupa.edu/, the Undergraduate Catalog, the Ram’s Eye View, and the University website at www.wcupa.edu.

### Title IX Statement

- West Chester University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report incidents of sexual violence shared by students to the University's Title IX Coordinator, Ms. Lynn Klingensmith.

- The only exceptions to the faculty member's reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred to the person designated in the University protection of minors policy. Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence is set forth at the webpage for the Office of Social Equity at http://www.wcupa.edu/_admin/social.equity/.

- Ms. Lynn Klingensmith is the West Chester University Title IX Coordinator and is also the Director of Social Equity. She can be reached at 610-436-2433 or by email at LKlingensmith@wcupa.edu and can connect you to resources both on and on campus, as well as provide information about the processes related to cases of sexual misconduct.

- West Chester University community members also have a right to report acts of sexual misconduct to the Office of Civil Rights. They can be contacted at: The Wanamaker Building, 100 Penn Square East, Suite 515, Philadelphia, PA 19107-3323, (215) 656-8541, OCR.Philadelphia@ed.gov


### Emergency Preparedness
