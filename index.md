  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  This is my academic website, where I provide and update information related to my current research, teaching, and blogging activities. I am currently an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.wcupa.edu/) at [West Chester University of Pennsylvania](https://www.wcupa.edu/). 

  My general research focuses on the areas of distributed systems, big data analytics, and computer science education. More specifically, I am interested in research problems that come from real world scenarios and can create learning opportunities to students, particularly undergraduates. I also am interested in interdisciplinary collaborative work where research computing technologies are combined with domain knowledge to address socially relevant research problems.
