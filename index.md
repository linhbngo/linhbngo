  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/computerScience/) at [West Chester University of Pennsylvania](https://www.wcupa.edu/). This is my academic website, where I provide and update information related to my current research and teaching activities.  

  My general research focuses on the areas of distributed systems, big data analytics, and computer science education. More specifically, I am interested in research problems that come from real world scenarios and can create learning opportunities to students, particularly undergraduates. I also am interested in interdisciplinary collaborative work where research computing technologies are combined with domain knowledge to address socially relevant research problems.
