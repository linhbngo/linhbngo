While preparing for the afternoon classes, I saw an email 
notification titled [Plans for Spring 2021](https://www.wcupa.edu/healthNotices/10.7Update.aspx). 
Already knowing about California State University System's decision to go online, I already had 
an idea about what this email would entail. Typically, I skimmed through this type of email. 
However, this time I decided to go ahead and watch the entire video. 

With half of a Spring semester, one Summer semester, and almost half-way through a Fall 
semester, I thought I would have been used to online teaching by now. To some extend, I 
was prepared to receive the news about online learning in Spring 2021. Yet, as the recording 
continued, I began to feel somewhat disappointed. Mind you, this decision had to be made. 
Yet, I still nurtured a small glimmer of hope that things would get better, a vaccine would 
come out, and we would be back on campus again. Sitting in my office and realizing my own 
disappoinment led me to wonder about how students would feel about this announcement. I 
decided to open a quick discussion with students in my classes that afternoon and the 
next day. The students range from sophomore to senior levels as the courses span three 
different levels (200/300/400). What I learned from the students was moving and enlightening. 

Overall, students expressed their dismay upon hearing the news. Several 
sophomore expressed an interest in taking a gap semester for Spring 2021 and only getting back 
in the Fall 2021 when classes are back in person. While none of the junior/senior was 
entertaining the same thoughts, a heavy level of disappointment was clearly displayed. To 
facilitate the discussions beyond simple venting, I directed students' comments toward 
two main questions:

- What are the bad things about online learning (that leads to thoughts about taking gap semesters)?
- What are the good things about online learning?

## Good things about online learning

- **Commuting, commuting, commuting:** Many of our students communte from nearby locations. The 
time required could range between 15-20 minutes to 1-2 hours, not accounting for the time 
to find a parking place. My class attendance has been great this semester, and I attribute a 
significant part of it to students' ability to, and I quote, `roll off the bed and into the class!`. 

- **Saving:** Many students acknowledge significant monetary saving from being able to staying 
with their parents and not having to commute and pay for parking. 

- **Flexibility:** Online learning allows students to have more non-traditional choices in 
balancing work and study. This advantage is highly appreciated by students that are near 
graduation. Students praised the ability to begin full time work or move to their spouse' 
location and can still finish up their degree remotely. Several were able to graduate earlier 
than originally planned because of this.

- **Course organization:** Students felt that having to deliever materials online made 
faculty to become more organized and more willing to share/publish learning materials online. 

And that was about all of the goods. Now on to the bad ...


## Bad things about online learning

Overall, students were worried about how their grades (and performance) are failing despite their 
best efforts. Several explicitly thought that online learning would delay their graduation time
Their concerns/challenges can be categorized into the followings: 

- **Time management:** a number of students mentioned that to do well in online courses will
require exceptional time management skills. Being at home created a sense of relaxation that 
caused them to loss track of time, just like how an extended vacation would feel. 

- **Outside distractions:** students who stay at home, while enjoy the benefit of saving on 
rents and commute, usually get pulled into doing chores/helping with sibling. Several indicated 
that their parents do not share an understanding about the time commitment required to study. 
Having younger siblings also staying home do not help. Others, while not being compelled by their 
family, felt that it was their responsibility to contribute, especially when many families are 
facing hardship due to the virus. 

- **Lack of interaction with faculty:** Without the face-to-face interactions between faculty 
and students, it is hard to convey body language, and letting faculty to “gauge” students’ 
understanding and adjust. One student specifically mentioned that if I moved out of the screen, 
it would be hard for him to read my lips and see what I am talking about (despite captions). They 
also feel that it is harder to retain information after Zoom sessions, comparing to in-class 
sessions. 

- **Difficulty in getting help:** this is perhaps the most critical issue. Getting assistance, 
feedback, and reminder from faculty and fellow students is very challenging. This can be due to 
slow in texting and/or difficulty in getting to office hours. Not being able to talk to 
classmates and inability to discuss details in projects are among other issues that cause frustration in students.

- **Unsuitable format of online learning:** some complains were raised about how rigid adaptation 
of in-person learning activities and assessment can be unsuitable for online learning. Several 
mentioned that online evening courses that last for three hours are just impossible to follow and 
many of them fell asleep (*I actually agree with the students here. In several conference 
planning committee, faculty were talking about how technical sessions longer than 60 minutes will 
cause listeners to tune out. If we can't do it, how can we expect our students to do it?*). Some 
didn't like asking questions in online classes because they felt like being put on the spot
(Zoom's focus?). Several students expressed their displeasures in online exames, as they felt 
that faculty focus too much on ensuring everyone does not cheat and not enough on making the exam 
truly about assessing students' knowledge. 

## Outcomes of the discussion

I intended for the discussion to be just about 15 minutes, and we ended going for 30-45 minutes 
in all of my classes. Despite all of the above issues, it seems that being able to talk about it 
was helpful to them. One of the surprising results of the discussion was that students became
active in looking for a solution. The most pressing issue, in their opinion, was the lack of 
interaction (more instantaneous interaction and not the delayed-email interaction) among students 
and between students and faculty. I was somewhat surprised by this as the department and the 
Computer Science Club have been maintained an online communication platform called [Slack](https://slack.com/), which were fairly popular in industry. 

It turns out that, since most of the sophomore students were younger, they were not as excited/
tuned to Slack as our upper classmen (Slack is old technology now!). I wonder if this is a 
generational issue, that is the underclassmen are coming in with a new set of technologies and 
are not willing to learn the **old stuff** so to speak. They probably also find that bonding with 
their own cohorts is easier. They ended up setting up a [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel 
(which I linked into the D2L course) and had everyone joined for discussions. Discord has 
voice-activated channels, which also helps with communication. As I typed in this blog article, 
I am reminded of an instance this afternoon where several of students were working and streaming 
their coding screens via one of the voice channel in Discord. We are getting there in term of 
making online/remote learning work better. 


## Conclusion

After these discussions, the lesson that I learned is that be truthful and communicate directly 
with students about challenges ahead is going to be very useful. In my opinion, at this moment, 
as they are frustrated, disappointed, and uncertain about their future, they need to be assured 
and encouraged. This is especially true for the freshman and sophomore. Maybe there have been 
study about online learning that mentioned this, and perhaps most faculty are already aware of 
it. But for the students, to be able to speak about their feelings and concerns and to listen to 
their fellow students sharing the same feelings are going to help the students to feel belonged 
and to move forward.
